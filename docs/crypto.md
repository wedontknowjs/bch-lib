# Bitcoin Cash Crypto
The cryptographic primitives (ECDSA and HMAC) implementations in this package have been reviewed by the Open Wallet Stack engineering team. More audits and reviews are welcomed.

## Point
The `btccore.crypto.Point` class contains a wrapper around the class Point of [elliptic.js](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic), the elliptic curve library used internally in btccore.

## ECDSA
`btccore.crypto.ECDSA` contains a pure JavaScript implementation of the elliptic curve DSA signature scheme based on [elliptic.js](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic).
